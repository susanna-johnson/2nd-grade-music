    In Unit 1, we learned to compose melodies with stepwise motion and jumps using our first five notes: D, E, F#, G & A.
      <br/>
      Students composed one song a week for nine weeks, increasing in complexity.
      The final student songs have 1 jump in the melody and 2 beats removed from the drums. The final cohort songs were composed as a class. The cohort songs have 2 jumps in the melody and either 1 or 2 beats removed from the drums. Each student chose the instruments and the tempo (speed) of their song.
      <br/>
      We used the software Chrome Music Lab Song Maker to compose these melodies. Please enjoy our work!
